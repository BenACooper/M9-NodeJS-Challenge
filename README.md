  ## Installation
  Visit the PWA online. Click the install button at the top left corner. Once installed the icon will be automatically added to your desktop or taskbar depending on your operating system. You can now launch the PWA Text Editor!
    
  ## Usage
  Simply type in your code snippets to the editor. It will color-code your snippets for readability. Any time you change focus away from the app it will autosave the current text in the editor. The next time you run the editor your most recent code snippets should be there! They are saved for 30 days so if the app is not run for 30 days the only content will be the default header.
